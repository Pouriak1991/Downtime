## What is it?

`treads` is a Python package that implements the framework presented in: 

Molina Hutt, C., Vahanvaty, T. and Kourehpaz, P. (2021). “An analytical framework to assess earthquake induced downtime and model recovery of buildings.” *Earthquake Spectra*, Accepted.

This tool is fully compatible with SimCenter’s tool for loss assessment, i.e., pelicun (https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/pelicun)
